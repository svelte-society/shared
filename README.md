## How to setup a Svelte Meetup in your City

1. Find a venue and confirm the date
2. Put it up online (Meetup.com or DownToMeet, or whatever meetup platform exists in your city)
3. DM [swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx), [Kevin](https://twitter.com/kevmodrome), or [Antony](https://github.com/antony) to help promote your meetup across Svelte Society channels
4. Get speakers! If you don't have any you can just go around and share what you like or want to learn about Svelte.
5. (optional) [Use our meetup template!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MQv2rMKtlV8pyXSNl1o8nksI1ma0gTF2A_DRFRIojJY/edit?usp=sharing)
6. Record video of your meetup!
7. We will add you as a channel manager for the [Svelte Society YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZSr5B0l07JXK2FIeWA0-jw) - you can upload your videos there, which helps promote your meetup but also put your city on the map!
